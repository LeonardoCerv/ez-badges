# EZ Badges

A dynamic SVG badge generator inspired by img.shields.io, featuring the ability to use your own image paths and convert them into SVG badges for your README files.

**Note:** The `iconColor` parameter works reliably with supported icon libraries but may have limitations with custom image paths.
